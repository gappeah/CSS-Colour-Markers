# CSS-Color-Markers
This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for a simple web page with three colored markers: red, green, and blue.
HTML Code

The HTML code is located in the index.html file. The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The main elements of the code include:

    The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which specifies the version of HTML used in the document
    The <html> and </html> tags, which enclose the entire HTML document
    The <head> and </head> tags, which contain information about the HTML document, such as the title and meta tags
    The <body> and </body> tags, which contain the visible content of the HTML document
    The <h1> and </h1> tags, which enclose the heading of the web page
    The <div> and </div> tags, which are used to group related elements together
    The <class> and class> attributes, which are used to apply CSS styles to elements

CSS Code

The CSS code is located in the styles.css file. The code is well-organized and uses meaningful class names to style the elements of the web page. The CSS code includes styles for:

    The font and text alignment of the heading
    The background color and padding of the container
    The dimensions and margin of the markers
    The colors, box shadows, and border styles of the caps and sleeves

Usage
